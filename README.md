## What is Hangfire?

Hangfire is an open-source library for .NET applications that allows developers to manage background tasks easily. It provides a straightforward API to enqueue, schedule, and execute tasks in the background while ensuring reliability and scalability. Hangfire integrates seamlessly with .NET applications and supports various storage backends.

## Key Features

1. **Task Queuing**:  
   - Allows enqueuing of tasks to run immediately or at a scheduled time.
2. **Recurring Jobs**:  
   - Supports jobs that execute periodically, such as daily reports or cleanup tasks.
3. **Dashboard**:  
   - Provides a built-in, real-time dashboard for monitoring job statuses.
4. **Distributed Processing**:  
   - Enables distributed task execution across multiple servers.
5. **Storage Options**:  
   - Compatible with databases like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, and others.
6. **Retries and Error Handling**:  
   - Automatically retries failed jobs and logs errors for debugging.
7. **Extensibility**:  
   - Customizable with middleware, filters, and plugins.
8. **Integration with Dependency Injection**:  
   - Works seamlessly with DI frameworks like ASP.NET Core's built-in container.

## How Hangfire Works

1. **Task Enqueueing**:  
   - Developers enqueue tasks using the Hangfire API (`BackgroundJob.Enqueue`).
2. **Storage**:  
   - Tasks and their states are stored in a persistent storage backend (e.g., SQL Server).
3. **Worker Threads**:  
   - Hangfire server processes the queued tasks asynchronously in the background.
4. **Dashboard Monitoring**:  
   - The built-in dashboard displays the status of jobs, including successes, failures, and retries.
